<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro-Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuro-stimulators market is segmented into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive neuro-stimulators, such as deep brain stimulators, involve surgical implantation to treat conditions like Parkinson's disease or chronic pain by directly targeting specific brain areas. Non-invasive neuro-stimulators, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), are applied externally and use electrical impulses or magnetic fields to manage pain or depression without surgery. Both types aim to enhance neurological function and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
